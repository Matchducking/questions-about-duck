# Match Ducking

> **⚠️ CURRENT STATUS (January 2026):** All ducking attacks have been suspended. InnerSloth has established better communication channels and is being more transparent. We are now working through direct reporting channels. This document serves as historical documentation of why we took these actions and under what conditions we might resume.

---

## Overview

Match Ducking is a coordinated effort to force Among Us developers (InnerSloth) to fix security exploits and address child safety issues in their game by making those problems impossible to ignore.

**Our Method:** We use automated bots to exploit vulnerabilities in Among Us servers, making games unplayable until the issues are patched.

**Our Primary Goals:** 
- Force InnerSloth to patch security exploits that have been reported for months
- Draw attention to the predator problem in Among Us dating lobbies
- Improve player safety, especially for minors

---

## The Dating Lobby Problem

Among Us has a serious predator problem. "Dating lobbies" are rooms created by predators, often targeting minors. These rooms typically have specific configurations:
- 4-6 max players
- 1 impostor
- Skeld map
- Appear in public matchmaking

These lobbies are used by individuals seeking inappropriate interactions, including pedophiles, racists, and others with malicious intent.

### InnerSloth's Inadequate Systems

**Current problems with Among Us moderation:**
- **Easy filter bypasses** - Simple tricks circumvent lobby name filters
- **Dating lobbies continue at massive scale** - Hundreds of predatory rooms active daily
- **Weak, client-sided age detection** - Age gates are trivial to bypass
- **No off-lobby reporting** - Can't report rooms unless you join them
- **No persistent reporting** - No way to report repeat offenders across sessions

---

## Why We Resorted to Ducking

**Ducking is our last resort.** Before taking this extreme approach, we exhausted every legitimate channel:

### What We Tried First

✅ **Official Support Tickets**
- Multiple formal reports submitted
- Received only automated bot responses
- No human engagement or acknowledgment

✅ **Social Media Outreach**
- Contacted InnerSloth on Discord
- Reached out on X (Twitter)
- Attempted communication on other platforms
- All attempts ignored or met with generic responses

✅ **Public Documentation**
- Created long-form videos documenting the issues
- Public disclosures of vulnerabilities
- Detailed evidence of the predator problem

✅ **Large-Scale Data Collection**
- Tracked thousands of predator friend codes
- Documented patterns and scale of the problem
- Compiled extensive evidence

✅ **Direct Executive Contact**
- Attempted to reach InnerSloth executives
- Explored every available communication channel
- Still no meaningful response

**Evidence:** [InnerSloth Contact Attempts](https://github.com/Matchducking/innersloth-contact-attempts)

> "These people don't realize that I'm not doing this for my own attention or ego. I'm doing it to bring attention to what InnerSloth has become. With their current communication and moderation systems, it's extremely difficult to report exploits to the actual developers rather than just InnerSloth's support bots. I also want to raise awareness because InnerSloth clearly isn't doing enough to deal with dating lobbies."

> "I don't even like to duck, since it affects too many people — but it's the only way I've been able to get InnerSloth's attention and actually push for these specific vulnerabilities to be fixed."

### The Result: Nothing Changed

Despite months of legitimate attempts through proper channels, InnerSloth:
- Continued creating cosmetics and monetization features
- Ignored security vulnerabilities
- Failed to address the predator problem
- Responded only with automated bot messages

**This left us with a choice:** Give up and let the problem continue, or force InnerSloth to pay attention.

### Our Approach

We don't enjoy disrupting the game for regular players, but it's the only method that has actually worked:

1. **Initial Phase:** Aggressive disruption (banning/lagging players) to get InnerSloth's attention
2. **Sustained Phase:** Reduced aggression once we confirm they're working on patches
3. **Monitoring Phase:** Continue presence to maintain pressure without heavy disruption
4. **End Phase:** Stop when exploits are fully patched

**Example from April 2025:** After InnerSloth began working on patches, we shifted from kick bots to hosting fake dating lobbies (4-6 players, 1 impostor configuration). This addressed the issue less aggressively - normal players could continue playing while we targeted the predatory lobby configurations. InnerSloth ultimately chose to ignore the dating room issue anyway.

**Note:** We intentionally limit ourselves from the most harmful exploits available. We could do much worse but choose not to.

## What We're Responsible For

✅ **Our Actions:**
- Massive bot ban wave (January 2025) - "MatchHacking" project
- Vote ban/kick wave (April 2025+)
- DuckDater fake dating rooms (April 2025+)

❌ **Not Our Actions:**
- Earlier lobby murder bots
- Parasites Central spam bots
- Other malicious raids

**Proof:** We've published portions of our source code in this repository.

## Key Projects

### Host Ducks (Released October 8th)
Our first fully functional project that overloads servers by hosting thousands of fake lobbies, specifically targeting dating lobby configurations (a problem InnerSloth refuses to address).

## Important Clarifications

### We Are NOT SickoMenu
Some people think SickoMenu developers are behind our raids. **This is false.** We used their techniques but are a separate group. We briefly posted "kellnotwirk" messages as a joke but stopped when people misunderstood.

### The SuperSus Incident
We apologize for the SuperSus jokes that caused drama. Examples of our joke messages:
- "MatchDucking: Global Offensive - Powered by SuperSus dot io"
- Various other SuperSus references

We didn't expect this to cause issues.

## Current Status (2026 Update)

InnerSloth has patched most of the exploits we targeted. More importantly, **as of early 2026, InnerSloth has established more direct communication channels and appears to be much more transparent and active than before.**

### Why We've Stopped Attacking

With these improvements in communication, we have **decided to stop all ducking attacks and return to direct reporting** of exploits and safety issues through their new channels.

**Important caveats:**
- We won't blindly trust everything
- We're monitoring to see if this transparency continues
- The proof will be in their actions, not just their words

**However**, the existence of proper communication channels is exactly what we were fighting for. If InnerSloth maintains this transparency and actually engages with security and safety reports, there's no need for disruptive tactics.

### Our Future

**We will return to ducking only if:**
- InnerSloth reverts to ignoring security reports
- The communication channels prove to be ineffective or abandoned
- New serious exploits threaten child safety and are not addressed through proper channels
- The dating lobby problem resurges without adequate response

**Our hope:** That ducking remains unnecessary because InnerSloth continues to engage meaningfully with the community on security and safety issues.

## Final Note

We understand this was an extreme approach and apologize for the disruption to regular players. However, after exhausting every legitimate channel for months, it was the only way to force meaningful security improvements - particularly regarding child safety.

**The core issue:** Among Us had become a hunting ground for predators, and InnerSloth failed to take adequate action despite extensive documentation and outreach.

We would have preferred to work with InnerSloth through proper channels from the start. They initially chose not to engage, which forced our hand.

**The good news:** As of early 2026, InnerSloth appears to have learned from this situation. With better communication channels now available, we're hopeful that ducking will remain a thing of the past. The community - and especially the children who play Among Us - deserve better protection, and it seems InnerSloth is finally taking steps in that direction.

*Most techniques mentioned here have been patched by InnerSloth.*
